Blackjack consists of 52 cards and 2 players: a player and a dealer. The goal of the game is to beat the dealer. The easiest way to do so is to get as close to 21 points as possible before the dealer or get a Blackjack (21 points exactly).  

A player loses if:  

1. The dealer gets closer to 21 points than the player at the end of the round.  
2. If a player has more than 21 points.  
3. If the dealer's hand value goes over 21 points.  
  
It's a tie when:  
  
Both players have the same points on their hands.  
  
Card's values:  
  
- Aces can be either 1 or 11 points - the player chooses the value;  
- Points for all other cards are their face value;  
- K, Q, J are 10 points cards;  
  
Just like typical blackjack you play in casino.
